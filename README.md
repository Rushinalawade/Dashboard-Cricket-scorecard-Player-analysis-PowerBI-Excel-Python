📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on in-depth analysis of each match and every player’s performance using Python for data analysis and Power BI for interactive visualization. The goal is to transform raw match-level and player-level data into meaningful insights that help understand performance trends, consistency, and impact.

The final outcome is a dynamic Power BI dashboard that provides a clear, visual representation of match outcomes and individual player performances.
